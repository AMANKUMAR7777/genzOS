# GenzOS

**GenzOS** is a fake, web-based operating system that is based on questionable humor of Gen Z, along with a bit of Italian brainrot. It’s not designed to be useful. It’s meant to feel like something funny in the back of your mind.

## What is it?

GenzOS is a browser-based simulation of a desktop environment, filled with brainrot apps, Gen Z memes, and silly interfaces. It is a digital playground for genz humor.

## Features

- Fake desktop with draggable app windows  
- Useless (but funny) apps  
- Gen Z vibes with brainrots  
- All coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMANKUMAR7777/genzOS
   cd genzos
   ```
2. Open index.html in your browser.  

That’s it. No build, no setup.
